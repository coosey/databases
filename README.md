# databases
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Description
This project focuses on applying the understanding of a Relational Database Management System. For this, I worked on solidifying my knowledge of MySQL and how to connect and use specific queries to obtain the desired data points.

### Steps:
1. Create a schema that will define the specific needs for the database and create necessary primary keys for each table
2. Install and setup local MySQL server and running database on command-line tool
3. Connect to the database server on the local machine
4. implement logic for the model and controller files and piece together end points to create a persistent SQL-backed server
